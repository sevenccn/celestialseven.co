            <h2>our little fairytale: "the seed that grew into a big tree" </h2>
            <div>
                <img src="img/aboutus_tree.jpg" alt="tree">
                <p>
                    We started with an idea, just like a little seed, that simple idea that seemed so far fatched
                    eventually turned into a funny yet amazing dream. A<i>"what if"</i>. We almost did let it stay a
                    <i>"what if"</i> because you see, thats what most of us do in society, we <strong> all </strong> get
                    ideas, dreams and goals but at the end of the day <strong>most of us</strong> end
                    up never chasing them because of the fear of failing. But were not like <strong>most of
                        them.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    You see we had our vision, it started so vague at first until it was crystal clear: we were going to
                    succeed and we would make our dream come true. We planted our seeds carefully along the way, we made
                    sure to follow every step in our roadmap where we would begin from inside the ground to make our way
                    up to the sun.

            We embarked on our journey around 2022, just as the pandemic dealt us a final blow, confining us to
            lockdowns and keeping us indoors. It was a challenging time for everyone, but where most saw darkness, we
            sought out the light. With everyone stuck at home, the founder of Celestialseven had nothing else to do but
            hope, dream, and conceive ideas so grand they seemed almost impossible. But that's what made it even more
            exciting. We began by sketching around, exploring various ideas for how the brand might look if we decided
            to go through with it. We stumbled upon many concepts but chose only a few. We needed a logo, branding, and
            something that would make us "stand out." Honestly, we didn't know what would make us stand out, so we
            decided to just be ourselves. What we most wanted our audience to say and hear from us is that we aim to
            display a form of kindness and creativity. With that in mind, we thought it might be a good idea to not only
            have a big logo on our clothing but also a mascot, a little being that would convey our message through art.
            In this case, a little bear, inspired by Koda from Brother Bear. Koda is a young bear always happy, loving
            to sing and go on adventures, carrying a positive attitude wherever he goes. When we decided our little bear
            would be our mascot, we felt like he might get lonely. So, we decided to give him a friend. As you may
            guess, the other one was also inspired by the big bear in Brother Bear: Kenai. Kenai used to be a young man,
            a human to be more precise. He was a brave, adventurous, and noble hunter. When he was human, he received a
            totem from his village: "Bear Of Love" We decided that our big bear would always carry that totem as we too
            believe in spreading love.

                    It's nice to meet you; I'm glad you stayed long enough to get to know our team and, more
                    specifically, me. I go by Seven, but for legal purposes, my actual name is Cheyenne Nahar. I was
                    just a senior in high school when I first started working towards our clothing brand. I always try
                    to say 'we' as I could have never done it without my wonderful team and you guys.
                    I've always loved creating stuff, whether drawing, painting traditionally, or digitally. I try never
                    to tie myself to rules or boundaries. Art has always been my outlet and a way to express myself, a
                    way to put my thoughts on a piece of paper. I've been doing that since I was a little kid. So, when
                    creating our logo, mascots, and really everything on the creative side, I truly enjoyed the process.
                    The reason I go by Seven is not even that special of a reason. I guess I just grew up with that
                    number, and it's part of the day I was born the 17th, for those who don't know. Also, for a fun
                    fact, I used to be number 7 back when I played basketball on a team. Oh and i guess i might have
                    just rolled with it because of the series Scissors Seven..Yeah definitely. Not really a big
                    backstory on the name, sadly, but if you guys have any questions, feel free to ask me on Instagram!"
